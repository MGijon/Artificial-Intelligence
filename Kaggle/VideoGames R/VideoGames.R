## Load the data.set
## =================

videogames <- read.csv('/Users/manuelgijonagudo/Documents/ProgramaciÃ³n/GIT/Machine-Learning/Kaggle/VideoGames R/Data/vgsales.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Data preparation
## ================

summary(videogames)   # explore the data
# We see that the variable year is taken as a character, we have to fix this
videogames$Year = as.numeric(videogames$Year)
summary(videogames)
# Now we see that there are videogames untill 2020, another thing to fix.
# We are gonna have dates until 2016

## Visualization
## =============

# plot the sales against the year
