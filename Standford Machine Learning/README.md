***

These are the exercises of the courese **Machine Learning** from **Standford** by Coursera. This files **are not the original exercises programed in Matlab/Octave**, these are versions of them programmed in other languages. 

This is because I do not want to help anyone to cheat in this course, this is a great course and worth doing it complete. The data files are not included, they are available at the course page.
